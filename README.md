My solutions to the assignments for [Berkeley CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

Note that I self-studied the course, so I cannot verify my solutions (although based on my results they seem to be correct).
To try my solutions on your own computer, make sure you have `pipenv` installed. I used `pipenv` to create and manage a virtualenv for each homework.
Run `pipenv install` in each individual directory to install the required packages. I ran into an issue installing `torch` with `pipenv`, so in 
addition to running `pipenv install` go to [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) and use their installation guide (make sure package manager is `pip`) to
install `torch`. Also make sure that MuJoCo is installed and in the correct directory. See `installation.md` inside the `hw1` folder for instructions.

All deliverables are in the `soln_pdf` folder inside each individual homework directory (e.g. `hw2/soln_pdf/hw2.pdf`).

This was developed on a Windows 10 PC.
